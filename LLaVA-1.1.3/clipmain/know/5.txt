This is a picture of healthy tomato leaves without any illness.
The typical characteristics of a healthy tomato can be described in four ways: plant morphology, foliage, root system and flower and fruit performance. First of all, healthy tomato stalks are erect and robust, with uniform internodes, usually reaching a diameter of 0.5 cm or more, and some varieties have dark green stalks with purple stripes. The height of the plant varies from variety to variety, with infinite-growing varieties able to elongate 2-3 centimeters per day at the right temperature.
As for leaves, healthy tomato leaves are spreading and plump, between 15-30 cm in length, rich green in color, with new leaves in proportion to old ones, without spots or deformities. The root system is well-developed with dense white fibrous roots, and the length of the main root can reach more than 20 centimeters after 30 days of planting. Flowers and fruits perform well, with 5-8 flowers per spike, obvious joints of flower stalks, bright yellow petals, smooth surface of fruits without edges, and uniform color.
The key techniques for healthy cultivation mainly include environmental control, water and fertilizer management, and disease and pest prevention. Environmental control should pay attention to the regulation of temperature, humidity and light, keeping the temperature at 25-28℃ during the day, 16-18℃ at night, relative humidity at 60-70%, and light intensity at 30-50klx. Water and fertilizer management, the fruiting period, we should keep the soil moisture content in the field water holding capacity of 70-80%, and use drip irrigation, with water supply of 0.5-1.5 liters per plant per day. Fertilization should be balanced, with special attention to supplementing calcium and magnesium.
Pest control should establish a preventive system, which can use a combination of biological control and physical measures. Biological control includes the release of natural enemies such as the Chilean small plant suibi mite to control red spider mites, and inoculation of the cotyledon mycorrhizal fungus to improve plant resistance. Physical measures include the use of insect nets to keep out pests and silver gray film to repel aphids.
Health diagnosis can be done through physiological monitoring and disease warning. Regularly measure photosynthetic rate, monitor leaf nutritional status, and take timely preventive measures in case of prolonged foliar dew on several consecutive days. High-quality, high-yielding healthy tomatoes should meet certain commercial fruit standards, including soluble solids content, fruit hardness and other indicators, while controlling the rate of deformed fruit.
