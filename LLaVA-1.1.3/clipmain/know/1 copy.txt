This is a photo of a leaf affected by tomato mosaic disease. The leaves are only affected by tomato mosaic virus disease and do not suffer from tomato early blight or tomato late blight tomato septoria leaf spot、tomato bacterial speck、tomato yellow leaf curl virus、two-spotted spider mite、tomato leaf mold And tomato target spot. The following is knowledge about tomato mosaic disease:
Tomato mosaic virus disease, plant disease. Foliar virus disease one is in the leaves of the occurrence of a slight foliage or mottled, plant growth and development is normal, plant height and healthy plants, the impact on yield is very little; the other is in the leaves of the occurrence of thick, light mottled, followed by newborn leaves become smaller, the veins of the leaf purple, the leaf blade elongated and narrow, twisted and deformed. Stem top leaf growth stagnation, plant dwarf, the lower leaves are more rolled, the ability of the disease plant bud differentiation is weak, a large number of flowers, buds, has been seated in the fruit, the fruit shape is small, the fruit surface is more like a flower face.
Disease Information: Virus 
Hazardous area: Leaf 
Hazardous symptoms: (1) Foliage: slight foliage or mottling of uneven shades of green occurs on the leaf blades, with normal growth and development of the plant, plant height is no different from that of the healthy plant, the leaf blades do not become small, not misshapen, and the plant does not dwarf, which does not have much impact on the yield. (2) A thick and light mottling occurs on the leaf blades, and then the newborn leaf blades become smaller, the leaf veins become purple, and the leaf blades are slender and narrow, twisted and deformed. Stem top leaf growth stagnation, plant dwarf, the lower leaves are mostly rolled, flower bud differentiation ability to reduce, a large number of flowers and buds, has been seated in the fruit, the fruit shape is small, fruit small quality is poor flower face. The impact on yield is great, and the diseased plants reduce yield by 10% to 30% compared with healthy plants.
Morphological characteristics of the pathogen: tobacco mosaic virus (Tobacco mosaic virus.), referred to as TMV, belongs to the + ssRNA order, (undefined) family, tobacco mosaic virus virus genus virus. Viral granules rod-shaped, size 300 × 18 (nm). Blunt temperature 90 ~ 93 ℃ after 10 minutes, dilution limit point 10-4 ~ 10-7, in vitro retention period of 72 ~ 96 hours. Pathogenicity under sterile conditions for several years, survival in dry diseased tissue for more than 50 years. There are different strains of this virus, and there are mainly four strains in China, such as common strain, tomato strain, yellow spot strain and pearl spot, etc. The differences in pathogenicity and the complex infection with other viruses cause the diversity of symptoms.
Infestation cycle: The pathogen can overwinter in living plants, in the soil or on disease residues within the soil, and in the pulp attached to the seeds. The insufficiently rotted poisonous fertilizer is also the source of the initial infestation. The suitable temperature for the disease is 20～25℃. The disease is mainly transmitted by the sap, aphids do not transmit the virus, during the growth of the plant, mainly through a variety of agricultural operations, contact infection. Diseased and healthy plants rub against each other, increasing the chance of sap transmission; planting is too dense, increasing friction, disease aggravation; locusts in the field, sooty mold bugs and other insects with chewing mouthparts can also transmit TMV virus. The disease is significantly aggravated in plots planted with lycophytes, especially tomatoes. Soil viscosity, insufficient fertility, poor drainage, resulting in poor plant growth and reduced resistance, application of unrotted or toxic organic fertilizers, and cultivation in soil with viruses can all exacerbate virus transmission. Soil sloughing, drought, field nematode damage in the field of heavy plots of heavy disease.
Morbidity factors (1) environment: the development of foliar disease has a close relationship with the temperature. The suitable temperature for the onset of the disease is 20～25℃. (2) Cultivation: foliar disease and streak disease are mainly transmitted by sap, so all the rough farming operations will increase the chance of transmission of the virus, sick and healthy plants rubbing against each other, increasing the chance of sap infection; planting too dense, increasing friction, disease aggravation. With the tomato plant crop plots, especially tomato crop, the disease will be significantly aggravated. Soil viscous, insufficient fertility, poor drainage, resulting in poor plant growth, often aggravate the disease. Soil lack of calcium, potassium, phosphorus and other elements, foliar disease occurs heavy, increase the application of calcium, potassium, phosphorus fertilizer can enhance plant disease resistance, reduce the occurrence of foliar disease. Sticky and humus-containing soil retains poison for a long period of time, which will make the disease occur seriously.
Prevention and control methods: 
Agricultural control: (1) timely removal of disease residues after harvesting, burned or dug pits and buried at places far from vegetable fields and water sources. Seedling before, seedbed thoroughly remove dead leaves and weeds; planting before deep turning the soil to promote the decay of the disease residues; the tools used in the diseased field, frame material to be sterilized. (2) Choose the field with convenient drainage and irrigation, open a good drainage ditch, reduce the water table, to achieve the rain stops without stagnant water; after heavy rain to clean the ditch system in a timely manner, to prevent moisture retention, reduce field humidity, which is an important measure to prevent disease. (3) apply enzyme bacteria compost or rotting organic fertilizer, do not use fertilizer with bacteria, organic fertilizer shall not contain plant disease residues; the use of formula fertilization technology, appropriate application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers, strengthen field management, cultivate strong seedlings, enhance plant resistance to disease, which is conducive to reducing the disease. (4) high temperature and drought should be scientific watering, in order to improve field humidity, reduce aphids, gray lice damage and the spread of other viruses, but also in the tomato rows to take measures such as paving grass moisturizing, is also conducive to reducing the disease. It is strictly prohibited to continuous irrigation and flooding. (5) according to local conditions, reasonable selection of disease-resistant varieties. Do not plant adjacent to tobacco. (6) Pitching, branching, tying vines when the first healthy plant after the diseased plant, contact with the hands of the diseased plant should be sterilized with soapy water, to prevent re-transmission through agricultural operations.
Chemical control: 
1, 1.5% phytophthora aqueous: used in the early stage of the disease, diluted 800-1000 times the liquid spray, every 7 days, 3-4 consecutive sprays. 2, 2% ninamycin aqueous: diluted 150-250 times the liquid spray The first time, every 7 days, continuous spray 3-4 times. 3, 5% mycotoxin aqueous agent: diluted 300-500 times liquid spray, every 7 days, continuous spray 3-4 times. In the early stage of the disease began to control, seize the best time to spray treatment.
The agent needs to be diluted according to the recommended ratio and then used to ensure that it is evenly sprayed on the plants. Spray every 7 days, 3-4 times in a row for optimal control. Alternate agents: To avoid pathogen resistance, it is recommended to alternate different agents. Disease monitoring: Regularly check the condition of the plants to detect and treat the disease in time to prevent further spread of the virus. Integrated control: Combine with agricultural control measures, such as selecting disease-resistant varieties and strengthening field management, to improve the control effect.
