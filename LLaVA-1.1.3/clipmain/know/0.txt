This is a photo of a leaf affected by tomato septoria leaf spot. The leaves are only affected by tomato septoria leaf spot and do not suffer from tomato mosaic virus disease or tomato early blight tomato late blight、Tomato bacterial mottle disease、tomato yellow leaf curl virus、two-spotted spider mite、tomato leaf mold And tomato target spot. The following is knowledge about tomato septoria leaf spot:
Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot is a common tomato leaf disease caused by the fungus Septoria lycopersici. It primarily affects the leaves, causing noticeable spots that hinder photosynthesis and reduce yields. Here is a detailed introduction to Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot:
Pathogen: (1) The disease is caused by the fungus Septoria lycopersici. This pathogen belongs to the Ascomycota division and is one of the common pathogens of tomatoes. (2) Pathogen characteristics: The fungus produces small black conidia, which are highly active in humid environments and can be spread by wind, rain, or irrigation water. The conidia penetrate the plant through stomata and start expanding, eventually forming spots on the leaves.
Symptoms: (1) Early symptoms: Initially, small water-soaked spots appear on the back of the leaves, and as the disease progresses, the spots grow larger, forming distinct round or irregular spots. (2) Typical symptoms: Leaf spots: Early spots are usually grayish-white with a distinct dark (dark brown) border. The center of the spots may appear pale gray or white, and small black dots (which are the conidia of the pathogen) are distributed in the center of the spots. Spot size: These spots typically range from 2-5 mm in diameter, but in favorable conditions, the spots may expand further and merge into larger spots. Leaf yellowing: As the spots expand, the green parts of the leaves gradually degrade, leading to yellowing, and in severe cases, leaves may prematurely fall off. Infection range: In addition to the leaves, the disease can sometimes infect the stems, causing small brown spots on their surface, and in severe cases, may affect the overall health of the plant.
Transmission: (1) Transmission mode: The disease primarily spreads through conidia of the pathogen, which are dispersed to healthy plants by wind, rain, water droplets, agricultural tools, or human activity. The pathogen can also be transmitted through seeds, so controlling the disease during planting is crucial. (2) Temperature and humidity conditions: The pathogen is especially active in humid environments. The disease spreads faster under warm and moist conditions, with optimal temperatures between 15-30°C.
Disease conditions: (1) Temperature: The optimal temperature for the disease is 20-25°C. High (>30°C) and low (<10°C) temperatures are unfavorable for the growth and spread of the pathogen. (2) Humidity: When relative humidity exceeds 85%, the spread of the pathogen and the germination of conidia occur more rapidly. Continuous rainfall or a humid environment favors the outbreak of the disease. (3) Leaf surface moisture: When there is prolonged moisture or dew on the leaf surface, the pathogen can more easily enter the plant through the stomata.
Infection cycle: (1) Pathogen life cycle: The mycelium and conidia of Septoria lycopersici can overwinter in diseased plant debris, and in the spring, they spread to new crops through wind and rain. (2) Infection cycle: The latent period of the disease is typically 5-7 days. In wet weather, the disease spots spread quickly, creating new sources of conidia. Generally, new conidia will form within 10-14 days after infection and begin to spread.
Control methods: Agricultural control: (1) Crop rotation: Avoid continuous planting of tomatoes or other Solanaceae crops. Implement a 2-3 year crop rotation to reduce the accumulation of the pathogen in the soil. (2) Field management: Implement proper spacing to enhance ventilation and light penetration, reducing humidity. Actively remove diseased plant debris, especially yellowed or infected leaves, to prevent the accumulation of the pathogen in the field. Remove and bury the diseased debris promptly to reduce disease sources. (3) Seed treatment: Use healthy or disinfected seeds to reduce the pathogen's spread through seeds. (4) Proper fertilization: Apply balanced nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers, avoiding excessive nitrogen to prevent overly vigorous plant growth, which can increase susceptibility to disease.
Chemical control: (1) Pesticide spraying: When the disease occurs early, apply appropriate fungicides such as chlorothalonil, copper-based fungicides, or mancozeb to control the spread. Spray every 7-10 days and repeat 2-3 times. (2) Fungicide rotation: Use different types of fungicides to avoid the development of pathogen resistance. (3) Ecological control: Greenhouse management: In greenhouses, maintain appropriate temperature and humidity. Avoid excessive humidity and over-watering. Provide timely ventilation and reduce humidity to minimize disease occurrence.
Prevention recommendations: Seed disinfection, the use of disease-resistant varieties, and proper field management and fertilization can enhance plant disease resistance. Maintain good field hygiene and promptly remove plant debris, especially after harvest, to ensure the disease does not spread.
By implementing these measures, the occurrence of Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot can be effectively reduced, ensuring higher yields and better-quality tomatoes.
