This is a photo of a leaf affected by tomato target spot. The leaves are only affected by tomato target spot and do not suffer from tomato mosaic virus disease or tomato early blight tomato late blight tomato septoria leaf spot、Tomato bacterial mottle disease、tomato yellow leaf curl virus、two-spotted spider mite、tomato leaf mold. The following is knowledge about tomato target spot:
Tomato Target Spot (Target Spot) is a disease caused by fungi, mainly affecting tomato and other tomato crops, which can lead to yield loss or even crop failure. 1.
1. Pathogen 
Scientific name: Corynespora cassiicola (Corynebacterium multilocularis).
Characteristics: fungal pathogen, can infect leaves, stalks and fruits. Strong adaptability, easy to break out in high temperature and high humidity environment. Host range is wide, in addition to tomato can also harm cucumber, pepper and other crops.
2. Symptoms 
Leaf blade: small watery spots appear at the beginning, and then expand into round or irregular-shaped spots. Typical spots are concentric whorls, with yellow-brown edges and gray-white centers (similar to the “bullseye”). In severe cases, the spots are in succession, and the leaves wither and fall off.
Stems and stalks: brown sunken spots are produced, which may result in broken stalks or fruit loss.
Fruit: black sunken spots are formed on the surface, reducing the commercial value.
3. Pathogenesis conditions 
Environment: Temperature: 25-30℃ is optimal. Humidity: Relative humidity > 80% or persistent rainy weather is easy to develop.
Cultivation factors: planting too dense, poor ventilation and light transmission. Continuous cropping or previous crop residues are not cleaned up. Excessive nitrogen fertilizer, weak plant resistance.
4. Transmission pathways 
Primary infection sources: disease residues, soil, germ-carrying seeds or neighboring host weeds.
Mode of transmission: wind and rain, irrigation water, agricultural operations (such as pruning) to spread conidia.
5. Control measures 
(1) Agricultural control 
Crop rotation: rotate crops with non-crops (e.g. corn, beans) for more than 2 years. Clean field: timely removal of diseased leaves, diseased fruit, after harvesting thoroughly destroy the disease residues. Reasonable dense planting: improve ventilation and light transmission conditions, reduce field humidity. Water and fertilizer management: balanced fertilization (increase the application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizer), to avoid flooding.
(2) Chemical control 
Seed treatment: soak the seeds in 50℃ warm water for 20 minutes before sowing, or mix the seeds with fungicides (such as carbendazim). Pharmaceutical spray (selected at the beginning of the disease): protective fungicide: diclofenac, chlorothalonil. Therapeutic fungicides: phenyl ether metronidazole, pyrimethanil, pyraclostrobin (pay attention to the rotation of drugs to avoid resistance). Biological agents: Bacillus subtilis, doxycycline.
(3) Disease-resistant varieties: choose disease-resistant (resistant) varieties, such as some hybrid tomato varieties.
6. Precautions: Early detection and early control, focusing on protecting the middle and lower leaves. Add additives (such as silicone) to improve the adhesion of the liquid when spraying. Greenhouse cultivation needs to control humidity, the use of drip irrigation or sub-film irrigation.
