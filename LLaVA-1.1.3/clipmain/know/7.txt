This is a photo of a leaf affected by tomato leaf mold. The leaves are only affected by tomato leaf mold and do not suffer from tomato mosaic virus disease or tomato early blight tomato late blight tomato septoria leaf spot、Tomato bacterial mottle disease、tomato yellow leaf curl virus、two-spotted spider mite And tomato target spot. The following is knowledge about tomato leaf mold:
Tomato leaf mold is caused by the fungus Fulvia fulva (formerly known as Cladosporium fulvum) caused by the exclusive parasitic disease, after the onset of the onset of the tomato leaves, stems, flowers, fruits will appear on the symptoms, but commonly occurs in the leaves, the initial appearance of some faded green spots on the back of the leaves, and then later become gray or black purple irregularly shaped mold layer, the front of the leaf blade in the corresponding part faded green and yellow. The front of the leaf blade in the corresponding part of the fading green and yellow, when serious, the leaf blade often appear dry and curled.
Mainly harmful to protected land (greenhouse, greenhouse) tomato, in high humidity, medium temperature environment is easy to outbreak, when serious, leading to early leaf failure, yield loss of 30% ~ 50%. The disease has a fast spread, easy to produce drug resistance characteristics, is one of the important diseases in tomato cultivation.

1. Disease type 
Pathogen type: Deuteromycotina, Hyphomycetes.
Disease classification: fungal leaf diseases, belonging to the exclusive parasitic bacteria (only harm tomato and a few tomato plants).
Epidemiological characteristics: The disease is more prevalent in protected areas (greenhouses and greenhouses) than in open areas. Airborne transmission is the main, frequent reinfestation, easy to burst into disaster in a short period of time. 2. Hazardous parts: mainly affecting the leaf of tomato and tomato plants.
2. Hazardous parts: Mainly affects leaves, and in severe cases can infect stems, flowers and fruits, but the abaxial surface of the leaves is typically characterized by a moldy layer. 3.
3. Hazardous symptoms (1) leaf symptoms, initial: yellowish green irregular green spots appear on the back of leaves, without obvious edge. When wet, grayish-white mold (mycelium) is gradually produced on the spots. In the middle stage, the mold layer becomes gray-purple or brown (conidial peduncle and spores are formed in large quantities). The corresponding part of the leaf adaxial surface shows yellow spots, and in severe cases the leaf blade is curled. Late stage: the spots are in succession, the leaves wither and fall off, only the top new leaves remain, and the plant declines prematurely. (2) Stem, flower and fruit symptoms (less common). Stem: brown oval spots, high humidity can be seen mold layer. Fruit: black hardened spots are formed near the tip of the fruit, affecting commercialization. 4.
4. Pathogen morphological characteristics. Mycelium: colorless, septate, expanding between host cells. Conidiophores: from the stomata out, brown, slightly expanded at the top. Dendritic branching, bearing conidia. Conidia: ellipsoid or lemon-shaped, unicellular or dicellular, light brown to brown. Growing in bunches, size about 12~22 × 4~8 μm.
5. Infestation Cycle 
(1) Overwintering and Primary Infection 
Overwintering sites: Disease residues, soil, seeds (low germ-carrying rate). Spores remaining on the greenhouse/ greenhouse skeleton, trellis membrane.
Primary infection: When the environment is suitable, conidia spread to leaves through airflow and water splashing. They invade from stomata or directly penetrate the epidermis, with incubation period of 5-10 days.
(2) Re-infestation: A large number of conidia are produced on the diseased spots, spreading by wind and agricultural operations, which can lead to the disease of the whole field in a short period of time.
6. Pathogenic factors 
(1) Environmental factors 
Temperature: optimum 20~25℃, above 30℃ or below 12℃, the disease is suppressed. Humidity: Relative humidity >85% or dew on the leaf surface for more than 4 hours is easy to break out.
(2) Cultivation management: 1. Protected field cultivation: poor ventilation, high humidity, heavy disease. 2. High planting density: field shade, which facilitates the spread of pathogens. 3. Excessive nitrogen fertilizer: plant lengthening, reduced disease resistance. 4. Continuous cropping: accumulation of pathogens in the soil, which aggravates the disease.
7. Control methods
(1) Agricultural control (core measures): choose disease-resistant varieties: such as ‘Jinpeng 1’, ‘Zhongmai 9’, ‘Jiafan 15’ and so on. Crop rotation: rotate crops with non-cabbage crops (such as beans, corn) for 2~3 years. Moisture control management: greenhouses use under-membrane drip irrigation to avoid leaf surface drenching. Close the greenhouse in the morning to raise the temperature, and ventilate in the afternoon to reduce dew. Clean the field: remove old and diseased leaves in time and take them out of the field for destruction. After harvest, turn the soil deeply to reduce pathogen residue.
(2) Chemical control: 
Preventive medicine (before the onset of disease): Manganese zinc diclofenac (Dasan M-45), Chlorothalonil (protective fungicide). Pyrimethanil (Amicida), pyraclostrobin (Kelun). Therapeutic use (after the onset of disease): phenyl ether metronidazole (Sekol), flusilazole (Fosfomycin). Oxime-pentaconazole (Nadiazem), Chlortetracycline (biopesticide). Focus on spraying the back of the leaves, 1 time in 5~7 days, 2~3 times in a row.
Note: The disease is prone to resistance, need to rotate the use of drugs or the use of compounding agents (such as benzyl - pyrimethanil). The greenhouse can be fumigated with sulfur (250g of sulfur per 100m³ + 500g of sawdust, closed fumigation for 24 hours). (3) Biological control: Trichoderma harzianum and Bacillus subtilis sprays to inhibit the expansion of the disease.
